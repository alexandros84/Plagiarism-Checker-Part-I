stringA = "Most browsers implement the structured cloning algorithm, which allows you to pass more complex types in/out of Workers such as File, Blob, ArrayBuffer, and JSON objects. However, when passing these types of data using postMessage(), a copy is still made. Therefore, if youre passing a large 50MB file (for example), theres a noticeable overhead in getting that file between the worker and the main thread. All of these features run partially asynchronously, with non-blocking not meaning concurrency.

Non-blocking doesnt necessarily mean concurrency even if all of these features run asynchronously."

stringB = "One thing thats remained a hindrance for JavaScript is actually the language itself. JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, meaning multiple scripts cannot run at the same time. As an example, imagine a site that needs to handle UI events, query and process large amounts of API data, and manipulate the DOM. Pretty common, right? Unfortunately all of that cant be simultaneous due to limitations in browsers JavaScript runtime. All of these features run asynchronously, but non-blocking doesnt necessarily mean concurrency. Asynchronous events are processed after the current executing script has yielded."
